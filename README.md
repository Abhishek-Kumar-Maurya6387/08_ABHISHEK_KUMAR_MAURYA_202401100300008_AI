To develop a machine learning model that classifies plants based on their water requirements. The aim is to assist in efficient gardening and agricultural planning by understanding water needs from plant features.
Problem Statement :Water management is critical in agriculture and horticulture. Overwatering or underwatering plants can lead
to poor health or even plant death. By classifying plants based on their water needs, it becomes easier for
gardeners, farmers, and urban planners to optimize irrigation systems and water usage. This project
leverages a machine learning classifier to automate this classification based on plant features.
Data Set - Plant.csv 
The dataset includes various features describing plant characteristics. The target variable represents the
water requirement category (e.g., Low, Medium, High). Categorical features are encoded and numerical data
is used directly for training the model.
